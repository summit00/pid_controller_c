# PID Controller with RL Circuit Simulation (in C)

This project implements a simple but effective **PID controller in C**, applied to an RL (Resistorâ€“Inductor) circuit simulation. Itâ€™s ideal for learning how control systems behave and how PID works in practice.

## How to Run the Simulation (VS Code)

This project is preconfigured for **Visual Studio Code** with a `Run Task` option.

### Steps

1. Open the folder in **VS Code**.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and choose **Run Task**.
3. Select `build pid sim`.
4. Select `run pid sim and export CSV`.
5. Run Python script in tools/ folder and watch the simulated graph.
